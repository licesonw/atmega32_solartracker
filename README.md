# ATmega32 Solar Tracker

In this project, a light source following solar panel mount is developed on an ATmega32. The light source location is being detected by a LDR array. The 2-axis solar panel mount is actuated with two servomotors.

The code was developed on MacOS 10.13 and written entirely in Xcode 9. The tools used for the toolchain are the xavr Xcode plugin and the CrossPack AVR environment.
